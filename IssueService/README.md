# üìå Issue Service

## üí™ Description

**IssueService** is an independent microservice designed for environments like a campus where users can report infrastructure/maintenance/cleanliness problems, 
track their statuses, and get real-time updates.

This service provides:
- Issue Reporting (with location data)
- Viewing Issue Details
- Retrieving User Issues
- Updating Issue Status
- Publishing events through RabbitMQ

## üì¶ Domain Layer

The project uses a Domain-Driven Design (DDD) approach.

### 1. **Aggregate Root**
- The `Issue` class is the **Aggregate Root**.
- All operations like status updates are controlled via aggregate methods.
- Contains location data (latitude, longitude) for precise issue location tracking.

> üìÇ Path: `Domain/IssueAggregate/Issue.cs`

### 2. **Domain Events**
- Domain Events are triggered automatically inside the aggregate.
- Events are published using MediatR.

| Event Name | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `IssueCreatedEvent` | Triggered when a new issue is reported. |
| `IssueStatusChangedEvent` | Triggered when an issue's status is updated. |

> üìÇ Path: `Domain/IssueAggregate/Events`

### 3. **Event Handlers**
- `IssueCreatedHandler` listens to `IssueCreatedEvent` and publishes a message to RabbitMQ.

> üìÇ Path: `Application/Handlers/IssueCreatedHandler.cs`

## üõ¢Ô∏è Database Schema (MongoDB)

```json
{
  "_id": "ObjectId",
  "title": "Pipe burst",

## üêá RabbitMQ Integration

- **Queue Name**: `issue_created`
- Events are published in JSON format.

Example event payload:

```json
{
  "Id": "608d5e47b6f1a3c6c03fef01",
  "Title": "Broken sidewalk tile",
  "UserId": "user-123",

## üê≥ Docker Compose Setup

Running services via Docker Compose:

| Service | Description | Port |
|---------|-------------|------|
| MongoDB | NoSQL Database | `27017` |
| RabbitMQ | Message broker + UI | `5672`, `15672` |

## üîß Local Development

To run locally without Docker:

1. Ensure MongoDB and RabbitMQ are running.
2. Configure your `appsettings.Development.json` properly:

```json
{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Warning"
    }
  },
  "MongoDB": {
    "ConnectionString": "mongodb://localhost:27017",
    "Database": "issuedb"
  },
  "RabbitMQ": {
    "Host": "localhost",
    "Username": "guest",
    "Password": "guest"
  }
}
```

3. Run the application:

```bash
dotnet run
```

Access Swagger UI at:

```
http://localhost:5240/swagger
```
