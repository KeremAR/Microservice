## üì¶ Domain Layer

The project uses a Domain-Driven Design (DDD) approach.

### 1. **Aggregate Root**
- The `Issue` class is the **Aggregate Root**.
- All operations like status updates are controlled via aggregate methods.
- Contains location data (latitude, longitude) for precise issue location tracking.

> üìÇ Path: `Domain/IssueAggregate/Issue.cs`

### 2. **Domain Events**
- Domain Events are triggered automatically inside the aggregate.
- Events are published using MediatR.

| Event Name | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `IssueCreatedEvent` | Triggered when a new issue is reported. |
| `IssueStatusChangedEvent` | Triggered when an issue's status is updated. |

> üìÇ Path: `Domain/IssueAggregate/Events`

### 3. **Event Handlers**
- `IssueCreatedHandler` listens to `IssueCreatedEvent` and publishes a message to RabbitMQ (`issue_created` queue).
- `IssueStatusChangedHandler` listens to `IssueStatusChangedEvent` and publishes a message to RabbitMQ (`issue_status_changed` queue).

> üìÇ Paths: `Application/Handlers/IssueCreatedHandler.cs`, `Application/Handlers/IssueStatusChangedHandler.cs`

## üîê MongoDB Access

### Connection Details
The project now uses MongoDB Atlas - a cloud database service. Connection details:

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Connection Type | MongoDB Atlas Cloud |
| Connection Format | `mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster>.mongodb.net/` |
| Database | `IssueDb` |
| Collection | `issues` |

### Connecting with MongoDB Compass
1. Download and install [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass)
2. Use your Atlas connection string:
```
mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster>.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```
3. Important: Add `?retryWrites=true&w=majority&authSource=admin` parameters
4. Once connected, select the `IssueDb` database to view the `issues` collection

### Access from .NET Application
Connection settings are provided through environment variables in `docker-compose.yml`:
```yaml
environment:
  - MongoDB__ConnectionString=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority
  - MongoDB__Database=IssueDb
```

### Network Access & Security
1. Make sure your IP address is whitelisted in Atlas ‚Üí Network Access
2. Create a database user with appropriate permissions in Atlas ‚Üí Database Access

## üêá RabbitMQ Integration

### Overview
The service is configured to create and use RabbitMQ queues for publishing domain events. This allows other services to be notified of issue creation and status changes, enabling decoupled communication and processing.

### Queue Configuration

| Queue Name | Purpose | Durable | Auto-delete | Exclusive |
|------------|---------|---------|-------------|-----------|
| `issue_created` | For new issue events | `true` | `false` | `false` |
| `issue_status_changed` | For issue status update events | `true` | `false` | `false` |

Queue names are configurable via `appsettings.json` (`RabbitMQ:QueueName` and `RabbitMQ:IssueStatusChangedQueueName`).

### Connection Setup
- The connection to RabbitMQ is established at service startup.
- The service proactively connects to RabbitMQ and ensures all declared queues are created.
- Connection parameters are configurable via environment variables.
- Automatic retry logic (5 attempts with a 2-second delay) handles connection issues.
- Detailed logging for connection status and errors is provided.

### Events Published
Events are published in JSON format.

#### Issue Created Event (to `issue_created` queue)
**Example payload:**
```json
{
  "Id": "608d5e47b6f1a3c6c03fef01",
  "Title": "Broken sidewalk tile",
  "Description": "Tripping hazard near Engineering building",
  "Category": "Infrastructure",
  "PhotoUrl": "https://storage-url.com/photo.jpg",
  "UserId": "user-123",
  "DepartmentId": 3,
  "Latitude": 41.0082,
  "Longitude": 28.9784,
  "Status": "Pending",
  "CreatedAt": "2025-04-20T14:22:00Z"
}
```

#### Issue Status Changed Event (to `issue_status_changed` queue)
**Example payload:**
```json
{
  "IssueId": "608d5e47b6f1a3c6c03fef01",
  "NewStatus": "In Progress",
  // "UserId": "admin-user-456", // If available and configured
  "Timestamp": "2025-04-21T10:30:00Z"
}
```

### Implementation Details
- **Publisher Class**: `Messaging/Implementations/RabbitMQProducer.cs`
  - `PublishIssueCreated(object message)`
  - `PublishIssueStatusChanged(object message)`
- **Interface**: `Messaging/Interfaces/IRabbitMQProducer.cs`
- **Handlers**:
  - `Application/Handlers/IssueCreatedHandler.cs` (for `issue_created`)
  - `Application/Handlers/IssueStatusChangedHandler.cs` (for `issue_status_changed`)

### Docker Configuration
The service is configured to wait for RabbitMQ to be healthy before starting:
```yaml
depends_on:
  rabbitmq:
    condition: service_healthy
```
This ensures that RabbitMQ is fully operational before Issue Service attempts to connect.

---

## üìä Metrics and Monitoring

The service has been instrumented with Prometheus metrics to monitor its health and performance:

### Available Metrics
- **`issues_created_total`**: Counter of total issues created
- Default .NET Core metrics (.NET runtime, HTTP requests, etc.)

### Metrics Endpoints
- **Prometheus endpoint**: `/metrics` (scraped by Prometheus server)

### Monitoring
Metrics are visualized in Grafana dashboards:
- **Main Dashboard**: Available in `monitoring/grafana/dashboards/campus-caution-dashboard.json`
- **Metrics Display**: Issue creation rate, count, and service health are displayed

## üîÑ Integration with Other Services

### Department Service
- **Listens to**: `issue_created` queue
- **Action**: When an issue is created, Department Service receives the message and processes it (e.g., stores in its database, associates with a department).

### Notification Service
- **Listens to (Planned)**: `issue_status_changed` queue
- **Action (Planned)**: When an issue's status changes, Notification Service will receive the message and send a notification to the relevant user.

### API Gateway
- All requests to Issue Service are routed through the API Gateway.
- API Gateway forwards requests to Issue Service at: `http://issue-service:8080`
- External access via API Gateway: `http://localhost:3000/issue/*`

### Future Integrations
- **Mobile App**: Will consume issue data via API Gateway.

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### RabbitMQ Connection Problems
- Check if RabbitMQ container is running: `docker-compose ps rabbitmq`
- Verify RabbitMQ credentials match in both `docker-compose.yml` and service config (`appsettings.json`).
- Check logs for connection errors: `docker-compose logs -f issue-service | grep "RabbitMQ"`
- Ensure queue names in `appsettings.json` are correct.

#### MongoDB Connection Issues
- Verify MongoDB Atlas connection string (including username/password).
- Check if IP address is whitelisted in MongoDB Atlas.
- Test connection using MongoDB Compass.

#### Service Won't Start
- Check service dependencies (especially RabbitMQ health check in `docker-compose.yml`).
- Verify environment variables in `docker-compose.yml`.
- Check for port conflicts on the host machine.
